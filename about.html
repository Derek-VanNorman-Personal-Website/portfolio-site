          When I am not attending Fullstack Bootcamp, being a father to my two
          kids, or a husband to my lovely wife I am doing one of the following.
        </h1>

        <h2>Building</h2>
        <p>
          Last year my wife and I took a chance and sold our home in town to
          aquire 10 acres in the country. Our end goal is to raise our children
          on a homestead of sorts. This propterty will eventually have gardens,
          a pond, food plots for hunting and other activities for us and our
          kids to participate in.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Biking</h2>
        <p>
          My family and I spend a great deal of time outside. Our kids are still
          very young so one of the activities we enjoy doing is biking. My wife
          and I have a toddler/child seat attached to each of our bikes so our
          children can ride along. This activity is great for getting us out of
          the house as a family while working on our fitness
        </p>
      
        <h2>Hunting</h2>
        <p>
          When I get time during the fall I try to spend as much time in the
          woods as possible. I enjoy sitting in nature and watching the
          wildlife. Of cousrse the goal is to procure food to eat, but most of
          the time I just watch. I also am a conservationist that enjoys making
          the land better suited for local wildlife to thrive.
