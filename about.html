      When I am not attending Fullstack Bootcamp, being a father to my two kids,
      or doing what my wife wants me to do I am doing the following.
    </h1>

    <h2>Building</h2>
    <h3>
      Last year my wife and I took a chance and sold our home in town to aquire
      10 acres in the country. Our end goal is to raise our children on a
      homestead of sorts. This propterty will eventually have gardens, a pond,
      food plots for hunting and other activities for us and our kids to
      participate in.
    </h3>

    <h2>Biking</h2>
    <h3>
      My family and I spend a great deal of time outside. Our kids are still
      very young so one of the activities we enjoy doing is biking. My wife and
      I have a toddler/child seat attached to each of our bikes so our children
      can ride along. This activity is great for getting us out of the house as
      a family while working on our fitness
    </h3>

    <h2>Hunting</h2>
    <h3>
      When I get time during the fall I try to spend as much time in the woods
      as possible. I enjoy sitting in nature and watching the wildlife. Of
      cousrse the goal is to procure food to eat, but most of the time I just
      watch. I also am a conservationist that enjoys making the land better
      suited for local wildlife to thrive.
