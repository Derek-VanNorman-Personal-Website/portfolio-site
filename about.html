              Last year my wife and I took a chance and sold our home in town to
              aquire 10 acres in the country. Our end goal is to raise our
              children on a homestead of sorts. This property will eventually
              have gardens, a pond, food plots for hunting and other activities
              for us and our kids to participate in.

              My family and I spend a great deal of time outside. Our kids are
              still very young so one of the activities we enjoy doing is
              biking. My wife and I have a toddler/child seat attached to each
              of our bikes so our children can ride along. This activity is
              great for getting us out of the house as a family while working on
              our fitness

            <p>
              When I get time during the fall I try to spend as much time in the
              woods as possible. I enjoy sitting in nature and watching the
              wildlife. Of cousrse the goal is to procure food to eat, but most
              of the time I just watch. I also am a conservationist that enjoys
              making the land better suited for local wildlife to thrive.
